# parameter-distribution

Parameter Distribution is a set of tools for SuperCollider which allow for generating values which can be set to parameters of spatially distributed synthesis processes. There are two groups of classes included – arrays and patterns. The former generate arrays of values. The latter does the same, but to be used as SuperCollider patterns, together with e.g., Pbind or Pmono.
