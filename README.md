# Parameter Distribution

The Parameter Distribution library features a set of tools for SuperCollider. They allow for generating structured arrays of values which can be set to parameters of spatially distributed synthesis processes, in order to synthesise a spatially differentiated texture. There are two groups of classes included â€“ arrays and patterns. The former generates arrays of values. The latter does the same, but as SuperCollider patterns, to be used together with e.g., Pbind or Pmono.

Installation:

1) download the Topographic Synthesis folder
2) download SuperCollider at https://supercollider.github.io/download
3) install SuperCollider
4) put the Topographic Synthesis folder in ~Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions
