# parameter-distribution

Parameter Distribution is a set of tools for SuperCollider which allow for generating values which can be set to parameters of spatially distributed synthesis processes. There are two groups of classes included â€“ arrays and patterns. The former generates arrays of values. The latter does the same, but as SuperCollider patterns, to be used together with e.g., Pbind or Pmono.

Installation:

1) download parameter-distribution
2) download SuperCollider at https://supercollider.github.io/download
